## For advanced Git/GitHub users (Edit via cloning)

Below is the community practice for you to follow in contributing to develop this curriculum via cloning the files to your local machine.

  [https://github.com/](https://github.com/)

- Fork the below repository into your GiHub account.
  [https://github.com/SLASSCOM/SLASSCOM-Bootcamp-Curriculum](https://github.com/SLASSCOM/SLASSCOM-Bootcamp-Curriculum)

- Install Git and clone the repository to your local machine

  `git clone https://github.com/<your_username></your_username>/SLASSCOM-Bootcamp-Curriculum`

- Add 'upstream' repo to your local cloned git repository so that you are able to obtain the latest directly from the 'upstream'.

  `git remote add upstream https://github.com/SLASSCOM/SLASSCOM-Bootcamp-Curriculum.git`

- Do edits to .md files by cloning your fork to the local machine using an IDE.
- Always take a pull from 'upstream' before sending a pull request with following command. This will help reduce merge conflicts and increase the chance of your pull requests getting accepted.

  `git pull upstream master`

- Submit a pull request to the [upstream repo](https://github.com/SLASSCOM/SLASSCOM-Bootcamp-Curriculum) via GitHub web UI of your fork.
- A moderator will attend to your pull request and accept, reject or request for changes.
