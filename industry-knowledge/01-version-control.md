### Self learning content

None

### Lecture content

Discuss the need of a _Version Control System_ in software development. There is no need to teach the internal architecture behind version control models. Awareness and the values that a version control system provide are more important at this stage.

- Evolution of version control systems
- Traditional models: File Locking, Version Merging, and Baselines
- Distributed models: Branch Repositories, Pull Requests, and Integrator Workflow

### Lab and tutorials

### Self learning content

Learn and try to get familiar with common usage of _Git Commands_ as instructed in this simple guide before coming to class:

[rogerdudler.github.io/git-guide](https://rogerdudler.github.io/git-guide/)

### Lecture content

Discuss briefly about common terminology in use:

- Repository, Branches, and Trunk
- Fork, and Clone
- Fetch, Pull, and Push
- Checkout, Commit
- Merge, Conflict, and Resolve
- Pull Requests

### Lab and tutorials

First, learn briefly about following version control tools and create `hello-world` project using each of the tool:

- TFVC project using Azure DevOps, and
- Git project using GitHub

Then, migrate the TFVC `hello-world` project on Azure DevOps to your choice of Git repository, preferably GitHub.

## Assessment 1

> Version Control

MCQ assessment (~20 Questions) verifying the understanding of the students in purpose and terms of version control. Preferably use a gamified assessment tool such as [Kahoot](https://kahoot.com).
